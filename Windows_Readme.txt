Alright! SUp!

I just thought i'd make your life a bit easier if you're using Windows.

For some reason these Linux chaps love .md files. Don't know why :P

But yeah, in case you were wondering how to open that .md file, well, use notepad.

If you're using the windows GUI, then right click on a repo name, click open in explorer, double click the .md file, select a program from the list of installed program, and use notepad, wordpad or notepad++. Associate the program with .md files if you want to.

Now that's a longish procedure, especially, like me, if you don't create an association for whatever paranoid reason.

So the other thing to do is use a CLI.

From your GUI, select "tools" on the top. from your list of shells, select whatever you want, i chose the command prompt (Cmd).

Now just rifht click a rep, click launch shell, and at the promt, type:
notepad readme.md <press enter/return>

Add your name to the end, save, got to the GUI, click the repo, commit, sync. Then trek back to the repo on GitHub's site, go to the full request tab, and click new pull request or something. Don't remember, but poke around and you'll get there. :P

exit cmd by using typing "exit", or simply clicking the close button on the top right of the window, in true Windows fashion.

Cheers,
Ojas
